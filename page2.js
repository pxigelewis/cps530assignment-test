            Due to the language be declarative, which means to expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
            With Reach, HTML is written using JavaScript, meaning the code that is written depends on the data. What makes React popular is that
            it designs simple views for each state in your application, and the library will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes.
            Due to this simplicity and flexibility, many people refer to React as the future of web develompent.</p>

            <p className="title">Express js is a backend development framework for Node js. The Language is
            designed to build single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for node. Because it is 
            built on Node.js, it has more features and, therefore, can be used to develop web applications. Because of its versatility and accessibility,
            it is popular to use as a a backend language, especially when it is easy to configure and customize </p>
            <h3 className="title">Strengths</h3>
            <ul className="title">
            <li>Built to ensure repetition of code does not occur; less coding time</li>
            <li>Routing and controller is provided</li>
            <li>It can handle many simultaneous requests without straining the server.</li>
            <li>Includes various middleware modules which you can use to perform additional tasks on request and response.</li>
